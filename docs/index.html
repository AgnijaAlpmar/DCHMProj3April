                     <p>This project is made for the course Digitising Cultural Heritage Material given by University of Borås and is an attempt of digitization of building plan drawings of Drottningholms palace theatre. It started as an interest to find initial architectural drawings, pictures and plans of Déjeuner Salon, a later annex to Drottningholms Palace Theatre in neo-classicism style, made by Louis Jean Desprez, finished in 1791. </p> 
                     <p>The images of architectural plans cover the two stages of history of this building. One part of the drawings are from the early planning stage of the current theatre, inaugurated in 1766, which has been built on the ruins of the tragically burnt down theatre house. The second part of the drawings, including the later annex from 1971, are based on the existing theatre building.</p> 
                     <p>The information on the website is presented in three layers. The first layer contains the home page with a short description  of the project, followed by a page “collection” where all digitised pictures are presented together with descriptions taken from the archive catalogue and at the third level where it is possible to see the chosen picture in a larger format.</p>
                     <p>The pictures were taken in 2023 by Agnija Alpmar, student at master's programme: Library and Information Science, Digital Library and Information Services.</p>
                     <p>The pattern for this webpage is made by Wout Dillen, Senior Lecturer in Library and Information Science at the University of Borås, 2022</p>
